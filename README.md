👋 Hi, I’m @KeithAGang 💻 I’m passionate about software development—from high-level systems to low-level internals 
🚀 Currently diving deep into Go, C#, TypeScript, and Python for systems and backend development 🛠️ Also exploring C, C++, Zig, and Rust for low-level and performance-critical programming 
🌱 Studying Computer Science and always hungry to learn 🤝 Open to collaborating on systems, tooling, and projects using modern stacks like React or SvelteKit
